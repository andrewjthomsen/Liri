# Liri
Liri interprets console commands to utilize multiple APIS
APIs used were Twitter, Spotify, IMDB and Request
To interact with Twitter, you can call Liri like this:
```
> node liri.js my-tweets
```
which will cause Liri to return your last 20 tweets.
One challenge that I faced with this project was connecting the utilized APIs. This was resolved by properly linking through the Node.JS function `require()`.
